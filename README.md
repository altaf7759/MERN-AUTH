# MERN-AUTH
🚀 Successfully Built an Authentication System with Node.js! 🔒✨
Hey everyone! 👋
I just completed building a Complete Authentication System using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, and JWT (JSON Web Token). 🔥

🎯 Key Features:
✅ User Registration & Login
✅ Email OTP Verification
✅ Secure Password Hashing with bcrypt.js
✅ JWT Authentication for Protected Routes
✅ Token-Based Authorization
✅ Forgot Password & Reset Password Functionality

I gained a deeper understanding of authentication flow, JWT handling, and secure user data management with MongoDB. 🛡️
